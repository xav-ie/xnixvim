  My nixvim (nixified neovim) config!

  Nixvim is an amazing project that brings nix to neovim. You can find out more on the [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim][nixvim repository]]. It makes running neovim with your complete config on alien systems easy, consistent, and fast! Try this command to run /my/ neovim configuration:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nix run github:xav-ie/xnixvim
  #+END_SRC

  Basically, if you have `nix` installed, you can run this configuation!

  I am still actively re-organizing this repository, so feel free to just poke around.
