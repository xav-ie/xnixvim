# markdown-table-sorter

Sorts markdown tables (stably) with Lua and Tree-sitter!

## Install

I don't know much about Vim packaging. I am sure you can figure it out.

I know most plugins have this format: `user/repo`. Here is mine: `xav-ie/markdown-table-sorter`.

## Sources

These sources helped me a lot with learning about how to make a plugin for Neovim:

- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) - comprehensive README
- [The Struggle To Write a Treesitter Plugin for Neovim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRd2zwF527M) - by _If Coding Were Natural_, they actually do not struggle at all and whip out some Lua type wizardry
- [tree-sitter explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09-9LltqWLY) - by _TJ Devries_, good general overview of Tree-sitter
- [Ok I tried Tree-sitter! Here is what I think about it...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8p-Jd9n-_I) - by _Tsoding_, I just like the streams :)
