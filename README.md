# xnixvim

My nixvim (nixified neovim) config!

Nixvim is an amazing project that brings nix to neovim. You can find out more on the [nixvim repository](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim). It makes running neovim with your complete config on alien systems easy, consistent, and fast! Try this command to run _my_ neovim configuration:

```sh
nix run github:xav-ie/xnixvim
```

Basically, if you have `nix` installed, you can run this configuation!

I am still actively re-organizing this repository, so feel free to just poke around.
